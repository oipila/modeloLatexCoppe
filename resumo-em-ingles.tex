  And taking advantage of the quote from Satoshi Nakamoto, there are also those who say: "Bitcoin was not supposed to be like that. This is not what Satoshi Nakamoto conceived". Note, I don't know what exactly the individual or group behind the Bitcoin invention conceived. But you see, every human invention encapsulates the knowledge and knowhow of its creator. Encapsulate your ideas. But after "free in the world", invention has a "life of its own", and the ecosystem that was created from the invention has a life of its own. For good and for bad. There is not much more to be said for this.

  We are near the end of the opinions I would like to express. One of the last concerns the opinions of politicians, investors, bankers and researchers about the future potential for cryptocurrencies. As I've already expressed, I see no reason to treat cryptocurrencies as an innovation unlike any other technological advance seen in humanity. And so, I am optimistic about the potential of cryptocurrencies, but realistic, far from the detachment from reality of some "moon boys". Now, one of the nuisances driving the perceived value of cryptocurrencies up is good news coming from these industries, which is fair, because it implies progress in adoption. On the other hand, there is the impact of bad news also coming from politicians, investors, bankers and researchers. And it is on this news that I want to do one of our latest mental exercises.
